# What is this?

This tool will help you understand how input is transformed on a system, which can help you craft better payloads.

Example: if you notice that a server responds with `c1aa46d751f1ffa58481418667134109ac5f573c` when you give in `test`, this tool will immediately tell you that itâ€™s `stringReverse(sha1(md5(md5("test"))))`.
